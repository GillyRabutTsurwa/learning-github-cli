Installation & Config (and Authentication)

i'll skip this as it is the easiest thing




ill sort this l8r

gh cli useful commands

gh â€”help 
gh auth login - will probably never need to use this one again
gh auth status

create repository on gh cli
gh repo create <repositoryName>

gh clone <ownerName>/<repoName>

gh fork (I need to come back to this one)

gh repo view
gh repo view <userName>/<repoName>

IMPORTANT: if you need more help on commands (maybe even subcommands too) do this:
gh <commandName> help
so if I need more info on managing my repos. I can do:
gh repo help
